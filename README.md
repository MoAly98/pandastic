I want to:
- Find failed/exhausted/finished jobs and retry them
- Find a readable summary of the error thrown for these jobs
- Be able to copy over input datasets to sites in case there are issues in current site (create rules)
- Be able to copy over output datasets to RSEs for longer shelf life (create rules)
- Montior rule creation in an intuitive way
